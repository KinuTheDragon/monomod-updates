# CelLua Monomod
This is a mod of CelLua Machine, originally made by KyYay. This repository contains a launcher as well as files required by the launcher.

# How do I download the latest version?
## For Windows
Just run the launcher. Make sure to run it as administrator or it won't be able to write the files properly. To make a shortcut for this, right-click on it and select Properties, then Compatibility, then check the box labeled "Always run as administrator".
## For other operating systems
Unfortunately, the launcher won't work. Make sure to download the appropriate `discord-rpc` file and place it next to your LOVE2D executable. Then download the latest version manually and run that.
